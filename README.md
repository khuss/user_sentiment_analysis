# user_sentiment_analysis

In this project we explore different NLP models to build text classifiers to determine the reception for a given movie based on user reviews. 

The classifiers will be trained on the IMDB_reviews dataset available [here]([hshs](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb_reviews)) to determine the overall sentiment of the user reviews, and whether if it is postive or negative.
