# user_sentiment_analysis

In this project we explore different NLP models to build text classifiers. The classifiers will be trained on the IMDB_reviews dataset available [here](hshs) to determine the overall sentiment of the user reviews, between positive and negative.

In short we will examine different models in the contrext of determining wether a user like or disliked a movie based on the reviews they left.
